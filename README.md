# Global COVID Death Statistics

In this project, I looked at a large data set of global COVID deaths vs. vaccinations. (source: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths)

Then I created a dashboard with Tableau (https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/christina.thai8531/viz/CovidDashboard_16440068109660/Dashboard1).
