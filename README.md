# PortfolioProjects

In this project, I looked at a large data set of global COVID deaths vs. vaccinations.

I got the data sets from Our World in Data (https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths).

I created a Common Table Expression (CTE), Temp Table, and View in SQL. 

Then I created a dashboard from the selected data in Tableau (https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/christina.thai8531/viz/CovidDashboard_16440068109660/Dashboard1).
